            <p class="customText textJustify">With the rising concerns of privacy relating to social media, communication, and how our personal data is used, Decentralized Applications (DApps) have become very popular. Unlike regular apps and centralized services, DApps give you control of your data.</p>
 <p class="customText textJustify">With Tritium, developers can use our API to build with conditional contracts, which can facilitate the management of ownership rights and decentralized exchange of many different kinds of assets and tokens. As the ownership of assets and tokens on Nexus is validated by a decentralized consensus, DApps on Nexus can replace the requirement for trusted third parties across many industries.
</p>
 <p class="customText textJustify">
Most DApps will likely begin development as private networks, launching as Sister or Hybrid Networks, to eventually become their own self-contained ecosystems. With the Amine upgrade, a file sharing system will be introduced, that will be used to store additional files associated with DApps.
