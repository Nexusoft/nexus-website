            <p class="customText textJustify">Nexus is comprised of two Embassies. Each of the Nexus Embassies is a nonprofit entity created for the purpose of technological development and adoption, alongside education. As nonprofit entities, they have no owners, are represented by a volunteer board of directors, and are operated by teams of creatives and delegates.</p>
            <p class="customText textJustify">The Nexus Embassies are independently funded by a portion of each NXS block that is mined. The NXS automatically transfers into the Embassy Signature Chains. Each Embassy is sovereign, creating a decentralized organization for network wide governance.</p>
            <p class="customText textJustify">Embassy Funding is reviewed every year, and voted on by the Nexus community.</p>
