                    <p>The impact that new technologies such as a truly decentralized blockchain could have on existing systems, is what fascinates me the most. I discovered Nexus in 2017, and was especially attracted by the prospect of a truly decentralized internet. The awesome Nexus team and their ‘no comprises’ approach - to do it the right way, instead of going the easy and wrong route, is why I started to help and support Nexus' Vision. I am active in all community channels for all questions, and my technical background helps me support the community with wallet problems. Due to my work in power engineering and energy economics, I am particularly interested in the impact of blockchain on the wholesale markets, energy trading, and the possibility of shared renewable assets.</p>
